## Instructions on how to play the game:
The game is provided as a Windows executable. To start playing, simply double-click the executable file. 
Use the WASD keys on the keyboard to move the player. Press ESC to pause the game.
As the name of the game suggests, the player takes on the role of a rock. The rock's goal is to collect all the crystals while surviving attacks from enemies. There are two types of enemies: the first one pursues the player following him, while the second can attack from a distance shooting at him from a turret. Both enemies can only reach the player if they are in a position to see it.

## Game
Starting from tutorial 2, we introduced several upgrades across different categories: enemies, graphics and UI, sound design, and camera view.

### Graphics
To enhance the game’s visual appeal, we decided to replace all models by importing assets from the Unity Asset Store. We opted for a low-poly style, bringing in trees, rocks, and rock walls to match this aesthetic. Additionally, we implemented a toon shader to create materials that complement the game’s overall look.
To complete the game’s look, we used the post-processing plugin to add finishing touches, including filters, motion blur, hue adjustments, grain, and other effects. 
The UI has also been enhanced, displaying lives, level number, and the coin count. We implemented a pause menu, a start menu, as well as win and lose screens.

### SoundDesign
We introduced sounds for the most important things in the game, such as the reach of the crystal, when the player dies, when the player is hitten and when the enemy turret shoots. Furthermore, we included some soundtracks to the game, taken from Bastion, developed by SuperGiant Games.
